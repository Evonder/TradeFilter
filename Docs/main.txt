== Not just any old filter!
//Please help localize this project// [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/trade-filter/localization/|HERE]]\\

TradeFilter does not only filter trade but has the ability to filter General, LookingforGroup, Say and Yell channels all which are configurable through the blizzard options panel. 

=== Channel Filters
TradeFilter has a set of patterns for trade channel and separate set of patterns for all other channels, or "base" channels as we will call them. This allows the user to define what patterns may be good for trade but not other channels and vise versa. The user also has the ability to add patterns of their own to be matched against for both trade and "base" channel filters.\\

##Trade Filters##:
<<code php>>
lf port,
buying,
wt[bBsStT],
lf[wWeE],
lf enchant,
lf jc,
AH,
looking for work,
lockpick,
selling,
buying,
<</code>>
##Base Channel Filters##:
<<code php>>
lf dps,
lf tank,
lf healer,
lf#m?,
lfm?,
lfg,
2v2,
3v3,
5v5
<</code>>
Adding a set, e.g. [xXyY], will attempt to find a match for any character given in a set. Example: lf[wWeEmM] will match for lfw, lfe and lfm.

=== Black and White Lists
TradeFilter also has a build in Black and White list. A sentence, or "string". that contains a black list match will cease to be checked any more and be filtered out completely. A string found that contains a white list match will also cease to be checked and will be allowed to passed un-filtered.

=== Filtering Priorities
The filtering priorities are as follows: Add-on is ON ->  is NOT friend -> is NOT self(unless filtering self for debugging) -> White list check -> Black list check -> Repeat check -> Filter

=== Configuration
<<code php>>/tf or /filter<</code>>

=== To Do ===
Nothing planned
