TradeFilter does not only filter trade but has the ability to filter General, LookingforGroup, Say and Yell channels all which are configurable through the blizzard options panel. 

TradeFilter has a base set of patterns that it will match against and ignore if found in a chat message. The user also has the ability to add a few patterns of their own to be matched against. The base pattern list is as follows:
<<code php>>
lf port,
buying,
wt[bBsStT],
lf[wWeEmM],
lf enchant,
lf jc,
lf dps,
lf tank,
lf healer,
lf#m?,
lfm?,
lfg,
AH,
looking for work,
lockpick,
selling,
buying,
3v3,
5v5
<</code>>
Adding a set, ie [xXyY], will attempt to find a match for any character given in a set. Example: lf[wWeEmM] will match for lfw, lfe and lfm.
